    <h1>What is it to be a <i>Victoria Secret Model or Angel</i></h1>
    <p>It's no accident that certain models are referred to as <i>"Angels"</i> 
    and others are simply <i>"models"</i>, as you may have noticed.
    In actuality, a model's wearing of wings on the catwalk does not automatically 
    qualify them as an angel. A model does not have a contract with Victoria's Secret; Angel does. 
    Angels are chosen internally at Victoria's Secret HQ, but if we had to guess, we'd say that they 
    presumably consider factors like popularity, walk, and general appearance. 
    A model must be able to do more than just the show for the company each year in order to advance to the position of Angel. 
    They must also participate in additional brand-related promotional events and appear in photo shoots all throughout the year. </p>

    <h1>Study Background of Victoria's Secret</h1>
    <p>Significant lingerie company <i>Victoria's Secret</i> has kept its reputation over time. At the advent of modernism, it gained appeal. 
        It is an American company that was founded in the 20th century and, after a few years, shot to fame around the world. 
        The beginning of Victoria's mysterious past can be found on June 4, 1977. 
        This business was founded by Roy Raymond, who took it from obscurity to fame. 
        It took Victoria's Secret some time to establish themselves as a household name in America. VS is a well-known brand that sells a lot of underwear, but it is no longer just for lingerie. 
        It has also successfully entered other markets. 
        Swimwear, fragrance, music CDs, body and bath care items, cosmetics, a line of sportswear, a pink collection of clothing and shoes for teenagers, and sportswear are some of the other products that Victoria's Secret has introduced. </p>
