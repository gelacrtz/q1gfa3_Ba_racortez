        <h1>Socio economic Status of Pshs smc students</h1>
        <h2>Exploring Socio Economic Variables: Qualitative and Quantitative Factors in the 3 Social Classes of the Filipinos </h2>
        <p>We chose to report about Socio-Economic Variables of Pisay Scholars. 
        Socio-Economic status is  a person's standing in society, which is based on factors like income, occupation, and social class; it is a measure of how their group is perceived by others. 
        This is important as it plays a vital role in understanding the dynamics of  society and its impact on individuals. We aim to explore the qualitative and quantitative factors that differentiate the 
        three social classes which are the Upper, Middle and Lower class within the Filipino population from a statistical perspective. The Upper class are individuals with significant wealth, access to exclusive resources, privileges, etc. 
        The Middle class are individuals that have stable incomes enough to provide comfortable living for themselves and their family. The Lower class are individuals that have limited resources, unstable incomes, and lack opportunities or social support.
        The data we gathered is based on a sample of 55 randomly selected high school students. By analyzing various socio-economic variables with this data and written report, we are able to have a better understanding of the advantages, 
        disadvantages and challenges faced by each social class, as well as identify the potential solutions to these problems.
